<h2>** currently in development **</h2>

<text>How old is your Spotify music? This program will analyze your Spotify data and tell you the average age of the music you listen to.</text>

<text>Built in Node using Express in Typescript.</text>

<text>Note to self: remember to never include my Spotify client_secret in the public repo. That is not ideal.</text>

<h2>Compilation/running instructions:</h2>

<text>Compile (watches for changes): npm run build</text>	

<text>Run: npm run start</text>

<text>This will use ts-node-dev to make the server restart upon any changes you make.</text>
